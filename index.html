            <p class="section-subtag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student
                is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.

            <p class="section-subtag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a
                complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but
                happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
                experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus
                on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can
                also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.

            <p class="section-subtag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values
                and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it
                stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions
                affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when
                school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like
                UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.

                Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation,
                intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are
                often linked to discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality, and
                parent involvement.
